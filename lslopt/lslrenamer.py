# This module renames all kinds of variables. Global variables, user functions,
# state names, event names and function/event parameters all take memory space,
# so shrinking the identifiers as much as possible, when possible (i.e. not for
# events or the default state), ensures their memory usage will be minimized.
# It also reuses some preexisting names. Locals are renamed also so that they
# don't stand in the way of globals.
#
# A side effect of this change is that the script becomes unreadable gibberish.
